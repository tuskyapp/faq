# Tusky Frequently Asked Questions

## Installing Tusky

### What Tusky release should I use?

There are three different releases of Tusky.

- The mainstream release. Unless you've been told otherwise, this is what you want
- Beta releases. These are released to testers before every mainstream release
- Nightly releases. These are released every night

### Where can I get Tusky?

You can install Tusky from Google Play or from F-Droid.

The mainstream release can be installed from:

- Install [Tusky from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky)
- Install [Tusky from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.keylesspalace.tusky/)

The beta release is only available from Google Play. You must opt-in to the beta programme.

- Opt-in to [Tusky Beta on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky)

Nightly releases are available on Google Play and F-Droid:

- Install [Tusky Nightly from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky.test)
- In the F-Droid settings, select My Apps > Repositories, and add a new repository with the link `https://releases.nailyk.fr/repo/`

### Why is the Tusky release on F-Droid out of date?

F-Droid builds Tusky from the source code when a new release is made available. This can take longer than it takes for the new release to available on Google Play.

## Managing my account

### Can I create an account with Tusky?

Not yet, you must create an account via a service like https://joinmastodon.org/ first.

Once you have done this you can then log in to the account in Tusky.

### Can I remove my account with Tusky?

You can sign out of your account with Tusky. But you will need to follow your instance's procedure to fully delete your account.

### I'm trying to log in to my account, and am being rick-rolled. Why?

Tusky does not support usage by accounts on some [servers](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/values/donottranslate.xml#L160) because of their association with hate groups.

> A server not being on this list does *not* imply endorsement by the Tusky developers.

If this offends you you are free to use another Mastodon client.

## Timelines

### Why is the count of likes and boosts different to the web?

This is because of how Mastodon works. Likes and boosts do not federate perfectly; if you and the other user are on different servers you will see different numbers between Tusky and the website.

### How do I see the Federated timeline?

From your home timeline:

- Open "Account Preferences" (swipe from the left edge, or tap your profile picture to see the option)
- Tap "Tabs"
- Tap the "+" button (bottom right)
- Choose "Federated" from the menu

You can adjust the order of tabs on this screen too.

### How do I hide boosted posts from my timeline?

- Open Preferences
- Tap the "Filters > Tabs" section
- Unselect the "Boosts" option

### How do I hide replies to posts from my timeline?

- Open Preferences
- Tap the "Filters > Tabs" section
- Unselect the "Replies" option

### How do I follow a hashtag?

- Tap the hashtag in a post to view all posts with this hashtag
- Tap the "follow" icon at the top right

### How do I mute a hashtag?

> This feature is available in Tusky 21 or above (including Nightly). To check the Tusky version you are using open the "About" menu.

- Tap the hashtag in a post to view all posts with this hashtag
- Tap the "mute" icon at the top right

## Posting

### How do I edit a post?

> This feature is only available in Tusky 21 or above (including Nightly). To check the Tusky version you are using open the "About" menu.

Find the post you want to edit, then:

- Tap the "..." menu at the bottom-right of the post
- Choose "Edit"
- Tap "Toot" to send the edited post (replacing the original)

### Why does Tusky only allow 500 characters when my instance has a custom character limit?

Your instance is not configured to report that it supports a custom limit using the Mastodon API.

This is something that your instance admins will need to change for you, Tusky cannot change it.

You can contact them and say:

> The instance is not exporting the `max_toot_chars` property at the `/api/v1/instance` endpoint. See e.g. here https://pleroma.site/api/v1/instance for a config that works with Tusky.

### How do I send a direct message?

> Important: Direct messages on Mastodon are not encrypted, and can be read by the admins of your instance. Be careful sharing any private information on Mastodon.

Create a new post, @-mention the user you want to send it to, then tap the "visibilty" icon (by default this looks like a globe) and set the post's visibility to "Direct".

## Notifications

### Why are notifications less frequent with Tusky?

By default, Tusky checks for new notifications approximately every 15 minutes.

Tusky can also use [Unified Push](https://unifiedpush.org/) to show notifications in real-time. To do this:

- Install "ntfy" (from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.heckel.ntfy)

## Filters

### Will my filters import from my instance?

Yes. Filters will sync in both directions between Tusky and your instance.

## Contributing to Tusky

### I want to help out, what can I do?

There are many ways you can help Tusky development.

- Bug reports and feature requests
- Translations
- Code and documentation contributions
- Donations

Well-written bug reports and feature requests help make Tusky better for everyone. The previous sections explains how to report bugs and make feature requests.

If you would like to see Tusky translated in to a language that you speak, or you see a problem with one of the existing translations you can contribute by sending in a fix. We use Weblate to manage translations; you can sign up at the [Tusky Weblate instance](https://weblate.tusky.app/) and submit a new translation, or improve an existing one there.

If you are familiar with Android development you can also send code changes via Github. A great way to start is to search the list of issues for a bug or feature request that is important to you, and start discussing how you want to solve it there. After any discussion you can then write the code and submit a PR with the change.

Financial donations are always welcome, and can be done through the [Tusky open collective project](https://opencollective.com/tusky). There you can sign up and make a one-off or recurring donation to the project.
